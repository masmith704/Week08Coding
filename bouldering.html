    <h3> What is Bouldering?</h3>

    <p>Bouldering involve no rope at all. Most of the routes in bouldering is rarely more than fifteen feet high. Bouldering is essentially
        a scaled-down version of sport climbing, which means repeated falling is expected, and the climb is all about the moves and technique. 
        If you're bouldering indoors, then all you need is proper athletic clothes, climbing shoes, and a chalk bag. Outdoors, you'll also need 
        some crash pads as well. In the end, though, it's ultimately just you and the rock, no rope to help. Boulder problems are graded 
        according to difficulty. Around here, you'll most commonly see bouldering routes graded according to the V system. The grading system is
        subjective and usually differs from person to person, but (generally) beginners' routes range from V0 to V2, intermediate problems most 
        often fall in the V3-V4 range, and advanced problems are V5 and above. But to give you some further perspective, the world's best 
        boulderers climb the V14 and above range. Ultimately, each progressive grade is significantly more difficult than its predecessor, and 
        the more difficult the grade, the longer it takes before a climber can progress to the next one. Additionally, climbing on rugged rock
        outside can make a difficult route even more difficult because of the physical wear and tear it induces on your fingers.</p>
