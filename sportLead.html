    <h3>What is Sport Lead?</h3>

    <div>
    <p id="Lead">This style of climbing is extremely versatile, offering a range of difficulties as well as a range 
    of route-lengths. Overall, though, lead and sport climbers predominantly focus on the moves and 
    techniques they use to get to their destination rather than the destination itself. In lead and sport 
    climbing, falling is expected and planned for accordingly. A climber working on a difficult route may
    fall dozens of times before he finally accomplishes it. The use of rope in lead and sport climbing 
    differs slightly from top-roping, though, in that there are a number of pre-fixed anchors bolted into 
    a wall or crag. These anchors follow the path of the pre-planned route from the beginning all the way
    to the end. It is the responsibility of the climber to loop her rope through carabiner systems called 
    quickdraws attached to each of the bolted anchors as she sends the rock. Don't forget, if you go lead
    or sport climbing, you'll need a partner belaying you; meaning feed you rope, catch your fall, and 
    lower you down.</p>
